# javascript-astar

## An implementation of the A* Search Algorithm in JavaScript

See a demo at http://www.briangrinstead.com/files/astar/

This project is also available to install via npm: `npm install javascript-astar`

## Sample Usage

If you want just the A* search code (not the demo visualization), use code like this http://gist.github.com/581352
```js
<script type='text/javascript' src='astar.js'></script>
<script type='text/javascript'>
	var graph = new Graph([
		[1,1,1,1],
		[0,1,1,0],
		[0,0,1,1]
	]);
	var start = graph.grid[0][0];
	var end = graph.grid[1][2];
	var result = astar.search(graph, start, end);
	// result is an array containing the shortest path
	var graphDiagonal = new Graph([
		[1,1,1,1],
		[0,1,1,0],
		[0,0,1,1]
	], { diagonal: true });
	
	var start = graphDiagonal.grid[0][0];
	var end = graphDiagonal.grid[1][2];
	var resultWithDiagonals = astar.search(graphDiagonal, start, end, { heuristic: astar.heuristics.diagonal });
	// Weight can easily be added by increasing the values within the graph, and where 0 is infinite (a wall)
	var graphWithWeight = new Graph([
		[1,1,2,30],
		[0,4,1.3,0],
		[0,0,5,1]
	]);
	var startWithWeight = graphWithWeight.grid[0][0];
	var endWithWeight = graphWithWeight.grid[1][2];
	var resultWithWeight = astar.search(graphWithWeight, startWithWeight, endWithWeight);
	// resultWithWeight is an array containing the shortest path taking into account the weight of a node
</script>
```
A few notes about weight values:

1. A weight of 0 denotes a wall.
2. A weight cannot be negative.
3. A weight cannot be between 0 and 1 (exclusive).
4. A weight can contain decimal values (greater than 1).

### Original (slower) implementation

The original version of the algorithm used a list, and was a bit clearer but much slower.  It was based off the [original blog post](http://www.briangrinstead.com/blog/astar-search-algorithm-in-javascript).  The code is available at: https://github.com/bgrins/javascript-astar/tree/0.0.1/original-implementation.

The newest version of the algorithm using a Binary Heap.  It is quite faster than the original.
