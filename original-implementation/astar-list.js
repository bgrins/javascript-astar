    ** You should not use this implementation (it is quite slower than the heap implementation) **
    
    Implements the astar search algorithm in javascript
    Based off the original blog post http://www.briangrinstead.com/blog/astar-search-algorithm-in-javascript
    It has since been replaced with astar.js which uses a Binary Heap and is quite faster, but I am leaving
    it here since it is more strictly following pseudocode for the Astar search
    **Requires graph.js**
